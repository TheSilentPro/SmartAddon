# SmartAddon
Library for creating "Smart" Slimefun4 addons

## Initialization
SmartAddon needs to register some resources before it can be used. <br>
This can be done by calling `SmartAddon.init(SLIMEFUN_ADDON)`,  it is easiest to call this in the main class in which can just use `this`.

## Usage
Coming soon...
